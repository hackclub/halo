# Halo üòá 

Halo was [Hack Club]([hackclub.com](https://hackclub.com/))'s 6th [Day of Service](https://days-of-service.hackclub.dev/), an initiative started to bridge the gender gap in technology. We organized a day of coding in partnership with a local youth organization, [The Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles](https://www.girlscoutsla.org/)!

On the weekend of November 4th, 9 Hack Clubbers gathered to host a 1-day hackathon for 39 Girl Scouts who, by the end of the event, created their first coding project! üíª

This repo is meant to serve as a point of reference for anyone wanting to organize their own Day of Service! If you have any other questions, reach out to [@brianna](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03R33X8XJB) on Slack. For more general information on how to organize a hackathon, check out [An Expandable Explanation into Hackathon Organizing](https://expandables.hackclub.dev/organizing.html) and see [how Hack Club can support you](https://hackathons.hackclub.com/)!

# üéØ The Goal 
Like past Days of Service events such as Horizon, Alpine, Spark, and Lonestar, our goal was two-fold:
1. To support Hack Clubbers to become more technical, become better leaders, and deepen friendships through fun, collaborative coding projects.
2. To grow Hack Club‚Äôs community so it is inclusive and accessible to teenagers of all backgrounds. We made active outreach to under-represented, marginalized gender & race minorities, who lack access to computer science programs or professional mentors in their community.
